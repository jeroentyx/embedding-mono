"# embedding-mono" 

My batch has a lot of difficulties when we first build our c++ game editor. One of the major difficulties was embedding c# to our c++ game engine.
Having said that, I researched the mono documentation and avaliable resources online at that time. I started with this solution and slowly get it working and usable for my c++ game engine.
With that, I published this repository as public to help my batch resolve their mono dll issues.
